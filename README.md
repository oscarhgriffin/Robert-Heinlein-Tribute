# Tribute-Page
This tribute page will demonstrate what I've learned studying HTML/CSS

I've completed the Responsive Web Design course on freecodecamp.org. In hopes of maximizing retention of the concepts I've learned, I've created this tribute page to communicate my nascent know-how of web design.

I've employed the use of flex box to create separate boxes with which I'll fill in information. I've not yet decided who I'll be dedicating this page to so all I have is placeholder text at the moment. I've realized I don't really understand the relationship between classes and IDs yet. I understand how they work, but I don't understand how a proper CSS is organized using these two attributes. My vision is a minimalist 'calendar view' of someone's life, such that the entirety of their life is visualized in the timespan of a month.
